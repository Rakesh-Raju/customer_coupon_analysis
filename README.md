Project: Customer Coupon Acceptance Analysis

This project aims to analyze a dataset containing various customer data related to their likelihood of accepting a coupon. The data was sourced from UCI's Machine Learning Repository, collected through Amazon's Mechanical Turk. The objective is to understand the factors influencing coupon acceptance and derive insights to potentially improve targeted marketing strategies.

Tools and Libraries Used:

    Jupyter Notebook: The primary environment used for analysis and visualization.
    Pandas: Utilized for data manipulation, cleaning, and processing.
    Numpy: Used for numerical operations and calculations.
    Seaborn: Applied for data visualization, including bar plots, histograms, and correlation matrices.

Steps Taken:

    Data Preprocessing:
        Imported the dataset into pandas DataFrames.
        Cleaned and filtered the data to remove irrelevant or missing information.
        Converted categorical variables into numerical values where necessary for analysis.

    Data Analysis:
        Performed operations to analyze customer behavior based on various attributes.
        Explored relationships between customer characteristics and coupon acceptance.

    Visualization:
        Used Seaborn to visualize distributions and relationships between key variables.
        Created bar plots, pie charts, and histograms to illustrate coupon acceptance patterns across different customer segments.

Results:

The project helped uncover valuable insights into customer behavior regarding coupon acceptance. The visualizations offer a deeper understanding of the factors that influence whether customers accept or reject coupons. Additionally, I explored alternate situations to discover how certain factors may influence decision making.
